## Project Description
The Tutor Me project is an idea that aims to provide a platform where students that need help academically can easily find a tutor that can help them with
specific modules. This project will be useful especially now that the covid-19 pandemic has made it much difficult to have face-to-face conversations, ask for help
with their studies from fellow students, and interact with lecturers for additional assistance. As with the rest of the world, every matter related to students is moving towards being digital and virtual. This project focuses on providing a platform to ease the process of:
- Registering as a Tutor that can tutor certain modules for a price,
- Registering as a Tutee that needs a tutor for certain modules,
- The tutor should be able to select the modules he/she tutors for a fee,
- The tutee should be able to choose which subject they need help with
from certain tutors,
- One-on-one chat functionality between Tutees and Tutors,
- Group chat creation for students requiring assistance with the same
modules or subjects,
- Sending and receiving notifications when Tutor is found
- Video calling functionality in-app to allow students to virtually meet After implementing these core functionalities of this project, we would start looking at
additional functionalities like filtering tutors by gender to enable students to choose someone that they are comfortable with. We would also look into implementing a dark mode of the app for users that prefer it over light mode. The project will be implemented as a cross platform mobile app for Android and iOS.

I am a self-motivated individual who has worked on multiple projects as a Business analyst(BA) as well as Project manager, both including university of Pretoria projects as well as other company projects.These roles have allowed me to lead teams into successful completion of working systems that are well documented ,easy to revisit,maintain and deliver. Alongside these roles I have worked on multiple object oriented systems, web applications and mobile applications.

I am a hard-worker and I am able to learn new technologies quickly. A team player with excellent communication skills. I find joy in finding innovative ways to solve problems and I am highly motivated. I have worked on projects as a backend (service) engineer and head of developer operations with different technology stacks and programming languages. I am a genuine believer in the fact that if you put in the work, it will work out. I know that everyone can be great at their best, so I always try to do my best even when I am not at my best which differentiates me from the rest.

Good with research, experienced tester and has great knowledge with DevOps. Experienced in design patterns, object-oriented programming; developing, testing,
and debugging code; designing interfaces and administering systems and networks. Quickly learn new technologies; successful working in both team and self-directed
settings.

I am good experience with backend programming, research on algorithms also can work on NestJS with Typescript/javascript, etc.Through my year here at the
University of Pretoria I haven also gathered basic knowledge on database and frontend programming technologies which will come in handy for this project. I am
able to adapt to new technologies and languages I enjoy acquiring new skills since the world of software development is huge and you can never know too much, this
may be considered as my shortcoming since learning a lot of things at the same time causes one to confuse different languages but it’s nothing a little research can’t solve when using a certain language or technology.

I am determined and I have a drive to build and create software systems since I believe that software systems are the backbone of the economy and the general
public. I believe I have a well balanced knowledge of backend development and front-end development, this includes designing of interfaces and server management
and development. I have vast knowledge in design patterns, and I have worked using the proposed methodology in a previous project. I am good at finding solutions
to proposed problems and debugging code. My shortcomings are that I tend to overthink and over analyse my work to the extent that I spend too much time on one aspect instead of spreading my effort on multiple aspects. I have since improved that by always being concise with my reasoning and
general programming.
